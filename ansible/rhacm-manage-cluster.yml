# Playbook to have RHACM manage a cluster
#
# Run this playbook such that the orchestration host can reach both the hub cluster
# as well as the managed cluster. Typically, this means it must run with the undercloud
# as the orchestration host.
#
# Example Usage:
#
# time ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/hosts ansible/rhacm-manage-cluster.yml -e "managed_cluster_name=shiftstack0000"
#
